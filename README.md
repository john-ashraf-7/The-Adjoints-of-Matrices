<h1>The Adjoints of Matrices</h1>
<p>This project, completed as part of the Linear Algebra course (Summer 2024) at AUC, explores the theory and practical applications of matrix adjoints. Under the guidance of Lecturer Daoud Siniora and TA Ibrahim Abdelaziz, we developed a comprehensive LaTeX paper and a functional programming solution, fulfilling all project requirements.</p>
    <h2>Part 1: LaTeX Paper on Matrix Adjoints</h2>
    <p>We produced a detailed LaTeX paper that covers the concept of matrix adjoints, including theoretical proofs and practical demonstrations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Defined the adjoint (or adjugate) of a matrix as the transpose of the cofactor matrix.</li>
        <li>Provided a rigorous proof of the relationship: A * adj(A) = det(A) * I<sub>n</sub>, demonstrating it with both an invertible and a non-invertible matrix.</li>
        <li>Established the commutative property of the adjoint operation: A * adj(A) = adj(A) * A.</li>
        <li>Derived a formula for calculating the inverse of an invertible matrix using its adjoint and determinant.</li>
        <li>Included a proof that matrices with a non-zero determinant are invertible, along with supporting theorems for completeness.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Part 2: Programming Solution</h2>
    <p>We implemented a program in Python to manipulate matrices and solve linear algebra problems:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Developed a function that converts any 4x4 matrix into its Row-Reduced Echelon Form (RREF) using elementary row operations.</li>
        <li>Extended the program to compute the determinant and inverse of a matrix, providing appropriate outputs for both invertible and non-invertible cases.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Team and Contributions</h2>
    <p>The project was a collaborative effort by our team, with each member contributing to both the LaTeX documentation and coding tasks. This project helped us deepen our understanding of linear algebra concepts and develop practical programming skills for mathematical computations.</p>
    <h2>Submission Details</h2>
    <p>The project was submitted on time as per the course guidelines, and all deliverables were verified for accuracy and completeness.</p>
