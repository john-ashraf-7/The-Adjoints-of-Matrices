<h1>The Adjoints of Matrices</h1>
<p>This project, completed as part of the Linear Algebra course (Summer 2024) at AUC, explores the theory and practical applications of matrix adjoints. We developed a comprehensive LaTeX paper and a functional code, fulfilling all project requirements.</p>
    <h2>Part 1: LaTeX Paper on Matrix Adjoints</h2>
    <p>We produced a detailed LaTeX paper that covers the concept of matrix adjoints, including theoretical proofs and practical demonstrations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Defined the adjoint (or adjugate) of a matrix as the transpose of the cofactor matrix.</li>
        <li>Provided a proof of the relationship: A * adj(A) = det(A) * I<sub>n</sub>, demonstrating it with both an invertible and a non-invertible matrix.</li>
        <li>Established the commutative property of the adjoint operation: A * adj(A) = adj(A) * A.</li>
        <li>Derived a formula for calculating the inverse of an invertible matrix using its adjoint and determinant.</li>
        <li>Included a proof that matrices with a non-zero determinant are invertible, along with supporting theorems for completeness.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Part 2: Programming Solution</h2>
    <p>We implemented a program in Python to manipulate matrices and solve linear algebra problems with the help of Numpy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Developed a function that converts any 4x4 matrix into its Row-Reduced Echelon Form (RREF) using elementary row operations.</li>
        <li>Extended the program to compute the determinant and inverse of a matrix, providing appropriate outputs for both invertible and non-invertible cases.</li>
    </ul>
